Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem.

Here's a high-level overview.
1. Generate a random solution
2. Calculate its cost using some cost function you've defined
3. Generate a random neighboring solution
4. Calculate the new solution's cost
5. Compare them:
	If cnew < cold: move to the new solution
	If cnew > cold: maybe move to the new solution

Repeat steps 3-5 above until an acceptable solution is found or you reach some maximum number of iterations.
